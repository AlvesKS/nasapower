# _nasapower_: NASA POWER Global Meteorology, Surface Solar Energy and Climatology Data Client <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

_nasapower_ aims to make it quick and easy to automate downloading
[NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) global meteorology, surface solar
energy and climatology data in your R session as a tidy data frame `tibble`
object for analysis and use in modelling or other purposes. POWER (Prediction
Of Worldwide Energy Resource) data are freely available for download at a
resolution of 1/2 arc degree longitude by 1/2 arc degree latitude. 

_nasapower_ offers further functionality to quickly and easily generate an
[`APSIM`](https://github.com/fainges/R-APSIM) package `metFile` format text file
from POWER data for use in the
[Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)](http://www.apsim.info/) or
an ICASA format text files for use in
[Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)](https://dssat.net/).

Please see
<https://power.larc.nasa.gov/> for more on the data and other ways to access it
and other forms of data available, _e.g._, your web browser or an ESRI REST API.

### Quick start

_nasapower_ can easily be installed using the following code.

#### From CRAN

The stable version is available through CRAN.

```r
install.packages("nasapower")
```

#### From GitHub for the version in-development

A development version that may have new features or bug fixes is available
through GitHub.

```r
if (!require(remotes)) {
  install.packages("remotes")
}

install_github("ropensci/nasapower",
               build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

### Example

Fetch daily "AG" community temperature, relative humidity and precipitation
for January 1 1985 for Kingsthorpe, Queensland, Australia.

```{r example}
library(nasapower)
daily_ag <- get_power(community = "AG",
                      lonlat = c(151.81, -27.48),
                      pars = c("RH2M", "T2M", "PRECTOT"),
                      dates = "1985-01-01",
                      temporal_average = "DAILY"
                      )
                    
daily_ag
```

## Documentation

More documentation is available in the vignette in your R session,
`vignette("nasapower")` or available online,
