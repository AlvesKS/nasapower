## Introduction

<img align="right" src="man/figures/nasapower-hex.png"> _nasapower_ aims to make
it quick and easy to automate downloading
[NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) agroclimatology data in your R session
as a tidy data frame for agricultural analysis and use in modelling or other
purposes. POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resource) data are freely
available for download through a web interface at a resolution of 0.5˚ longitude
by 0.5˚ latitude.

Please see
<https://power.larc.nasa.gov/> for more on the data and other ways to access it.

### Quick start

With the changes to the NASA/POWER data and API, this package is a
work-in-progress under active development, install at your own risk.

_nasapower_ is not available from CRAN, only GitHub. It can easily be installed
using the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github("adamhsparks/nasapower", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

_nasapower_ aims to make it quick, easy and efficient to automate downloading
NASA-POWER agroclimatology data in your R session as a tidy data frame.

_nasapower_ only provides one function, `get_power()`, which will download
specified variables and return a tidy data frame of the requested data. Weather
variables can be specified by using the `pars` argument. 

## Using get_power()

The `get_power()` function requires five arguments as seen in this example,
which will fetch relative humidity (RH2M) and temperature (T2M) for the year
1985 on a daily time-step.

```{r example, eval=FALSE}
power <- get_power(community = "AG",
                   lonlat = c(-179.5, -89.5),
                   pars = c("RH2M", "T2M"),
                   dates = c("1985-01-01", "1985-12-31"),
                   temporal_average = "daily")
```

The arguments are:

- `community`, a text string with valid values of: "AG" (Agroclimatology), "SSE"
(Surface meteorology and Solar Energy) or "SB" (Sustainable Buildings). The
selected user community will affect the units of the parameter and the temporal
display of time series data (_e.g._ Agroclimatology will use MJ/m^2^/day for
radiation units, while SSE and SB use kW/m^2^/day as units).

- `lonlat`, a length-2 numeric vector giving the decimal degree longitude and
and latitude coordinates in that order for cell data to download or a length-4
numeric vector giving the decimal degree longitude and and latitude coordinates
forming a bounding box as ymin, xmin, ymax, xmax in that order.

- `pars`, a character vector of weather variables to query for download. For a
complete listing of valid `pars`, please see column 1 of the package included
data, `parameters`, e.g., using RStudio, `View(parameters)`.

- `dates`, a vector of start and end dates for which to query the NASA-POWER API

- `temporal_average`, a character vector of the desired temporal average(s).
Valid values are "DAILY", "INTERANNUAL" and "CLIMATOLOGY".

## Documentation

More documentation is available in the vignette in your R session,
`vignette("nasapower")` or available online, 
<https://adamhsparks.github.io/nasapower/articles/nasapower.html>.

## Use of POWER Data

While _nasapower_ does not redistribute the data or provide it in any way, we
encourage users to follow the requests of the POWER Project Team.

> When POWER data products are used in a publication, we request the following
acknowledgment be included: "These data were obtained from the NASA Langley
Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate
Applied Science Program."
