## Introduction

<img align="right" src="man/figures/nasapower-hex.png"> _nasapower_ aims to make
it quick and easy to automate downloading
[NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) agroclimatology data in your R session
as a tidy data frame for agricultural analysis and use in modelling or other
purposes. POWER (Prediction Of Worldwide Energy Resource) data are freely
available for download through a web interface at a resolution of 1˚ longitude
by 1˚ latitude.

Please see
<https://power.larc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/agro.cgi?email=agroclim@larc.nasa.gov>
for the agroclimatology data web interface.

### Quick start

_nasapower_ is not available from CRAN, only GitHub. It can easily be installed
using the following code:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github("adamhsparks/nasapower", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Introduction

_nasapower_ aims to make it quick, easy and efficient to automate downloading
NASA-POWER agroclimatology data in your R session as a tidy data frame.

_nasapower_ only provides functions, `get_cell()`, for a given 1˚ longitude by
1˚ latitude cell and `get_region()`, both of which will which will download
specified variables and return a tidy data frame of the requested data. Weather
variables can be specified by using the `vars` argument. 

Both functions accept four arguments.

```{r arguments, eval=FALSE}
get_cell(lonlat = NULL, vars = c("T2M", "T2MN", "T2MX", "RH2M"),
  stdate = "1983-1-1", endate = Sys.Date())
```

- `lonlat` for `get_cell()` A length-2 numeric vector giving the decimal degree
longitude and and latitude in that order for cell data to download

- `lonlat` for `get_region()` A length-4 numeric vector of the minimum
longitude, maximum longitude, minimum latitude and maximum latitude.

- `vars` Weather variables to query for download, defaults to all available.
Valid `vars` include:

    * toa_dwn - Average top-of-atmosphere insolation (MJ/m^2/day)

    * swv_dwn - Average insolation incident on a horizontal surface (MJ/m^2/day)

    * lwv_dwn - Average downward longwave radiative flux (MJ/m^2/day)

    * T2M - Average air temperature at 2m above the surface of the Earth
    (degrees C)

    * T2MN - Minimum air temperature at 2m above the surface of the Earth
    (degrees C)

    * T2MX - Maximum air temperature at 2m above the surface of the Earth
    (degrees C)

    * RH2M - Relative humidity at 2m above the surface of the Earth (%)

    * DFP2M - Dew/Frost point temperature at 2m above the surface of the Earth
    (degrees C)

    * RAIN - Average precipitation (mm/day)

    * WS10M - Wind speed at 10m above the surface of the Earth (m/s)

- `stdate` Starting date for download, defaults to 01/01/1983 (there is no
earlier data)

- `endate` End date for download, defaults to current date

### Basic example of using get_cell()

Fetch all weather variables available for 1983-1-1 to current date for the cell
at longitude -179.5 and latitude -89.5.

```{r basic_example, eval=FALSE}
library(nasapower)

get_cell(lonlat = c(-179.5, -89.5))
```

## Use of POWER Data

While _nasapower_ does not redistribute the data or provide it in any way, we
encourage users to follow the requests of the POWER Project Team.

> When POWER data products are used in a publication, we request the following
acknowledgment be included: "These data were obtained from the NASA Langley
Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate
Applied Science Program."
