\usage{
get_cell(lonlat = NULL, vars = c("T2M", "T2MN", "T2MX", "RH2M", "toa_dwn",
  "swv_dwn", "lwv_dwn", "DFP2M", "RAIN", "WS10M"), stdate = "1983-1-1",
  endate = Sys.Date())
}
\arguments{
\item{lonlat}{A length-2 numeric vector giving the decimal degree longitude
and latitude in that order for cell data to download.}

\item{vars}{Weather variables to download, defaults to all available.
Valid variables are:
\itemize{
\item{\strong{toa_dwn} - Average top-of-atmosphere insolation (MJ/m^2/day)}
\item{\strong{swv_dwn} - Average insolation incident on a horizontal surface
(MJ/m^2/day)}
\item{\strong{lwv_dwn} - Average downward longwave radiative flux
(MJ/m^2/day)}
\item{\strong{T2M} - Average air temperature at 2m above the surface of the
Earth (degrees C)}
\item{\strong{T2MN} - Minimum air temperature at 2m above the surface of the
Earth (degrees C)}
\item{\strong{T2MX} - Maximum air temperature at 2m above the surface of the
Earth (degrees C)}
\item{\strong{RH2M} - Relative humidity at 2m above the surface of the Earth
(\%)}
\item{\strong{DFP2M} - Dew/Frost point temperature at 2m above the surface of
the Earth (degrees C)}
\item{\strong{RAIN} - Average precipitation (mm/day)}
\item{\strong{WS10M} - Wind speed at 10m above the surface of the Earth
(m/s)} }}

\item{stdate}{Starting date for download, defaults to 01/01/1983 (there is no
earlier data).}

\item{endate}{End date for download, defaults to current date. Note that data
is often available only with a lag of days to a month or more. The last
available data will be silently returned with \code{NA} for any values not
yet reported.}
}
\value{
A tidy \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} object of the requested variable(s)
for the requested longitude and latitude values.

\description{
Download NASA-POWER (Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource)
agroclimatology data for a given 1 degree x 1 degree cell for a range of
days to years.

The agroclimatology data are satellite and modelled derived solar and
meteorological data. The POWER website describes the data as:
\itemize{
  \item{Near real-time 1째 x 1째 daily time series of solar radiation and
  meteorology}
  \item{Daily total solar radiation from July 1, 1983 through near real-time}
  \item{Daily averaged air temperature (average/minimum/maximum/dew point)
  from January 1, 1983 through near real-time}
  \item{Daily averaged precipitation from January 1997 through February 2013}
  \item{Global coverage on a 1째 latitude by 1째 longitude grid}
}
}
\note{
The order in which the \code{vars} are listed will be the order of the
columns in the data frame that \code{get_cell()} returns.
