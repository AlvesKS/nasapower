# _nasapower_: NASA-POWER Data from R <img align="right" src="man/figures/logo.png">

_nasapower_ aims to make it quick and easy to automate downloading
[NASA-POWER](https://power.larc.nasa.gov) global meteorology and surface solar
energy climatology data  data in your R session as a tidy data frame `tibble`
object for analysis and use in modelling or other purposes. POWER (Prediction Of
Worldwide Energy Resource) data are freely available for download through a web
interface at a resolution of 0.5 arc degree longitude by 0.5 arc degree
latitude. Further functionality is provided to quickly and easily generate an
[APSIM](https://github.com/fainges/R-APSIM) package `metFile` object from POWER
data for use in the
[Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)](http://www.apsim.info/) and
ICASA format text files for use in
[DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer)](https://dssat.net/).

Please see
<https://power.larc.nasa.gov/> for more on the data and other ways to access it
and other forms of data available, _e.g._ an ESRI REST API.

### Quick start

_nasapower_ is not yet available from CRAN, only GitHub. It can easily be
installed using the following code:

```r
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
  library(devtools)
}

devtools::install_github("adamhsparks/nasapower", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Documentation

More documentation is available in the vignette in your R session,
`vignette("nasapower")` or available online,
<https://adamhsparks.github.io/nasapower/articles/nasapower.html>.

## Use of POWER Data

While _nasapower_ does not redistribute the data or provide it in any way, we
encourage users to follow the requests of the POWER Project Team.

> When POWER data products are used in a publication, we request the following
acknowledgment be included: "These data were obtained from the NASA Langley
Research Center POWER Project funded through the NASA Earth Science Directorate
Applied Science Program."
